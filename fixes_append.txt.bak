**FIX: Store Actions Defensive Checks & Startup Logic - COMPLETED 2025-06-20**
   Problem: Store actions could fail if data structures weren't proper arrays; no flexible startup screen selection
   Root Cause: Tasks/timers could be non-array types; startup hardcoded to dashboard
   Fix Applied:
   - main-helios.ps1: Added array type checks in TASKS_REFRESH and TIMERS_REFRESH actions
   - Added flexible startup with -start <path> parameter support
   - Fixed simple test screen route to use /simple-test to match module name
   - Added validation and fallback for invalid startup paths
   Result: More robust data handling and easier testing of specific screens
